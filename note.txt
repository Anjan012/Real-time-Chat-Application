npm install react-router-dom  : This library is used for routing 

<BrowserRouter>
Think of this as the "GPS system" for your app. It:

Watches the URL in the browser address bar
Tells React which component to show based on the URL
Handles navigation without page refreshes (Single Page Application magic!)

Example: When URL changes from / to /auth, BrowserRouter notices and updates the page

<Routes>
This is like a "traffic controller" that:

Contains all possible routes in your app
Decides which route matches the current URL
Only shows ONE matching route at a time (first match wins)


note:--
shadcn is just a wrapper the top of radix ui
if you want to go with complete scratch project and you want your own style then go with radix ui but if you want predefined style for these components then you can use shadcn--


 npm init --yes : yes is the default option 

 installing package in the server------------------------------
 we are installing express framework (handles requests, serves responses),
 dotenv to read environment variables,
 cors to communicate to client to server,
 cookie parser to parse and get our cookies,
 mongoose package to interact with the database,
 bcrypt to encrypt our password,
 jsonwebtoken package for json web tokens- like The membership card (remembers who's logged in)

npm i express dotenv cors cookie-parser mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken

in package,json in server we add "type":"module" cause - use import statement....

----------------------------------------------------
dev dependices are used in development helps developer but in production after hosted not used 
Development tools (like nodemon) help you code but aren't needed in production. This tool will save you SO much time!
Whenever we save our node js file application we need to restart our server side app to get the changes but but node js does automatically nodemon watches changes and automatically restart the application 
npm install nodemon --save-dev  




------------------------------------------
added inside script in packgae.json 
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },

"start": "node index.js"

When you run: npm start
What it does: node index.js
Purpose: Runs your server in production mode
Behavior:

Starts the server once
If you make code changes, nothing happens
You have to manually stop (Ctrl+C) and restart
Used when deploying to production


"dev": "nodemon index.js"

When you run: npm run dev
What it does: nodemon index.js
Purpose: Runs your server in development mode
Behavior:

Starts the server
Watches for file changes
Automatically restarts when you modify code
Perfect for development

cookie-parser-------------------------------
middleware
